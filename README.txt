IMPORTANT

This is just a test created with brackey's tutorial fps multiplayer shooter.
I will not be adding or continuing this as Unet is being deprecated soon for a new version.
When that version comes out I will learn more about it but this game is not really a game as it is not balanced or tested.
For company viewing and casual viewing to see that I do know the concepts of an online game in Unity even if Unet is not being continued after it's creation.
